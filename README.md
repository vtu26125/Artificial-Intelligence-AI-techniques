## 🧩 Task Descriptions

### 🔹 **Task 1 – Stock Market Using BFS**

Implements a **Breadth-First Search** algorithm to explore different investment options or trading paths to reach an optimal state. Demonstrates the concept of state-space exploration in decision-making.

### 🔹 **Task 2 – Vehicle Routing Using Hill Climbing**

Uses the **Hill Climbing** algorithm to minimize the distance or cost for vehicle routing. It showcases how local search can be applied for optimization in logistics and transport problems.

### 🔹 **Task 3 – Map Navigation Using A* Search**

Implements **A*** algorithm to find the shortest path between two locations on a map. Combines heuristic estimation and cost-based exploration for efficient route discovery.

### 🔹 **Task 4 – Tic Tac Toe Using Minimax**

Builds a simple **AI-based Tic Tac Toe game** where the computer plays optimally using the **Minimax Algorithm**. Demonstrates game theory and decision-tree-based AI strategies.

### 🔹 **Task 5 – Optimizing Delivery Routes Using Ant Colony Optimization**

Applies the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** metaheuristic to simulate ant behavior and find optimal delivery routes. It highlights swarm intelligence and probabilistic decision-making.

### 🔹 **Task 6 – Graph Coloring**

Solves the **Graph Coloring Problem** using constraint satisfaction techniques. Ensures that no two adjacent nodes share the same color, demonstrating CSP in scheduling and allocation.

### 🔹 **Task 7 – Robot Traversal to Fetch a Tool**

Implements a **pathfinding AI** to help a robot navigate through obstacles and reach the tool’s position efficiently. Can be modeled using search algorithms or grid-based traversal.

### 🔹 **Task 8 – N-Queens Problem Using Backtracking**

Classic **Backtracking problem** where N queens are placed on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Demonstrates recursion and constraint checking.

### 🔹 **Task 9 – Build an Intelligent Chatbot System with Python**

Creates a basic **Chatbot system** using NLP libraries and pattern-matching logic. The chatbot responds to user queries using predefined responses or simple ML-based models.

### 🔹 **Task 10 – Implement Simple Facts Using Python**

Demonstrates **Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR)** using Python’s logic-based constructs. Implements simple **facts and inference rules**, similar to a Prolog-like system.
